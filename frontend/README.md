# Frontend Application

This README provides an overview of the frontend application, specifically focusing on the `index.html` file located at `frontend/app/index.html`.

## Overview

The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point for our frontend application. It is responsible for structuring the initial HTML content and loading necessary resources.

## File Location


frontend/app/index.html


## Key Features

1. **HTML5 Structure**: The file uses the HTML5 doctype and includes essential meta tags for proper rendering across devices.

2. **Responsive Design**: It incorporates viewport meta tags to ensure responsive behavior on various screen sizes.

3. **Resource Loading**: CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files are properly linked and loaded.

4. **Application Root**: Contains a root element (typically with id "root" or "app") where the main application will be mounted.

## Usage

To view the application:

1. Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory in your terminal.
3. Run your development server (e.g., `npm start` or `yarn start`).
4. The application should now be accessible in your web browser.

## Customization

When modifying `index.html`:

- Ensure all necessary meta tags remain intact.
- Be cautious when changing the structure as it may affect the entire application.
- If adding new resources (CSS/JS), make sure they are properly linked.

## Related Files

- `frontend/app/styles/main.css`: Main stylesheet for the application.
- `frontend/app/scripts/main.js`: Main JavaScript file for the application logic.
